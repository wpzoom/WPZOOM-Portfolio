== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I just installed the plugin and can't find the Portfolio blocks =

Make sure you haven't disabled the new block editor using the Classic Editor plugin, as these blocks work only with the new editor. **If you have the Classic Editor plugin - disable it**!

= I'm getting a 404 error!  =

Sometimes you may see a 404 error on single portfolio pages. You can fix this easily by flushing your permalinks. Simply go to the  **Dashboard → Settings → Permalinks** and hit the “Save Changes” button on that page. This should fix the problem, as it's a known WordPress issue with Custom Post Types.
